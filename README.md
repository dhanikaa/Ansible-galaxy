```yaml
---

  become: true
  roles:
    - bsmeding.docker
```

Run the playbook with:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini docker-playbook.yaml
```

## Publishing Your Own Role to Ansible Galaxy

If you want to share your own role on Ansible Galaxy, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a GitHub Repository for Your Role
Create a GitHub repository with a name following the format: `ansible-role-<role-name>` (e.g., `ansible-role-docker`).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Structure Your Role Properly
Your repository should have the following structure:

```
ansible-role-docker/
‚îÇ-- defaults/       # Default variables
‚îÇ-- files/          # Static files
‚îÇ-- handlers/       # Handlers for services
‚îÇ-- meta/           # Role metadata
‚îÇ-- tasks/          # Task definitions
‚îÇ-- templates/      # Jinja2 templates
‚îÇ-- vars/           # Role-specific variables
‚îÇ-- README.md       # Documentation
```

You can generate this structure using:

```sh
ansible-galaxy role init ansible-role-docker
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your Role to GitHub
Push your role to GitHub:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ansible-role-docker.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Import the Role to Ansible Galaxy
To upload your role to Ansible Galaxy, use:

```sh
ansible-galaxy role import <github-username> <repo-name> --token <your-api-token>
```

For example:

```sh
ansible-galaxy role import myusername ansible-role-docker --token myapitoken123
```

To update an installed role, use:

```sh
ansible-galaxy role install <role-name> --force
```

For example:

```

### Installing Roles from a Requirements File
You can install multiple roles using a `requirements.yml` file:

```

Install all roles listed in the file with:
